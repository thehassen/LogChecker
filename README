First of all thanks to felixonmars for open-sourcing his logchecker.

The goal of this fork will be fixing some issues present in the current version and adding support for logs in other languages, mainly Spanish for a start.

Requisites:

* MoinMoin
* felixonmars' action plugin, available at https://github.com/felixonmars/process
